        Indiana, known as the "Hoosier State," offers a rich tapestry of history and unique attractions. It’s home to the Indianapolis 500, the largest single-day sporting event globally, held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which could fit several NFL stadiums inside its track. Indiana boasts the first long-distance auto race in the U.S. and is renowned for its love of basketball, producing legendary players like Larry Bird. The state also played a key role in the Underground Railroad, with the Levi Coffin House serving as a significant safe haven for escaped slaves. Additionally, Indiana is the leading producer of popcorn in the country, contributing to America's favorite movie snack.
